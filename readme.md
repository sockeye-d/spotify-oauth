# Spotify OAuth example
A simple example with a button that simply pauses the playback of Spotify, through their OAuth 2.0-authenticated API

To actually run this, first create a new file at `res://client.tres` with the type `OAuthSecret` and populate the missing information. Most of it can be found in the Spotify developer dashboard.
